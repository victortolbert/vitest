# Mocking Requests

Because Vitest runs in Node, mocking network requests is tricky; web APIs are not available, so we need something that will mimic network behavior for us. We recommend [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to accomplish this. It will let you mock both `REST` and `GraphQL` network requests, and is framework agnostic.

Mock Service Worker (MSW) works by intercepting the requests your tests make, allowing you to use it without changing any of your application code. In-browser, this uses the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). In Node.js, and for Vitest, it uses [node-request-interceptor](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-server#operation). To learn more about MSW, read their [introduction](https://mswjs.io/docs/)


## Configuration

Add the following to your test [setup file](/config/#setupfiles)
```js
import { beforeAll, afterAll, afterEach } from 'vitest'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { graphql, rest } from 'msw'

const posts = [
  {
    userId: 1,
    id: 1,
    title: 'first post title',
    body: 'first post body',
  },
  ...
]

export const restHandlers = [
  rest.get('https://rest-endpoint.example/path/to/posts', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.status(200), ctx.json(posts))
  }),
]

const graphqlHandlers = [
  graphql.query('https://graphql-endpoint.example/api/v1/posts', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.data(posts))
  }),
]

const server = setupServer(...restHandlers, ...graphqlHandlers)

// Start server before all tests
beforeAll(() => server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'error' }))

//  Close server after all tests
afterAll(() => server.close())

// Reset handlers after each test `important for test isolation`
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
```

> Configuring the server with `onUnhandleRequest: 'error'` ensures that an error is thrown whenever there is a request that does not have a corresponding request handler.

## Example

We have a full working example which uses MSW: [React Testing with MSW](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib-msw).

## More

There is much more to MSW. You can access cookies and query parameters, define mock error responses, and much more! To see all you can do with MSW, read [their documentation](https://mswjs.io/docs/recipes).
